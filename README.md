This is the source code of Albam, a [Blender](https://www.blender.org) addon that lets you import and export video game models.

### Installation
Albam works in Blender versions 2.70 and above. Other versions below might work but haven't been tested.
If you don't already have blender, you can download a copy at [](https://www.blender.org/downloads/)

* Download the latest release from the [releases section](https://github.com/Brachi/albam/releases)
* Without unzipping the file downloaded, [install as an addon](https://www.blender.org/manual/advanced/scripting/python/add_ons.html#installation-of-a-3rd-party-add-on) by going to File--> User Preferences and then to the 'Addons' tab. There click 'Install from file' and select the zip file downloaded. Lastly, enable the addond by checking the checkbox.


### List of games supported
Currently the project is in alpha stage, but many more games are to be added soon once the code becomes more stable
As of version 0.0.1, the only game supported is Resident Evil 5 (Biohazard 5) for PC.
